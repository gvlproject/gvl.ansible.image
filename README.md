This Ansible role is for building the machine image required to run the GVL.
It is likely to be used in the context of the GVL playbook.

Requirements
------------
The role has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 14.04. It requires `sudo` access.

Dependencies
------------
This role depends on the cloudman-image role, which in turn depends on several
other roles. To satisfy these requirements it is necessary to install the required
roles with the following commands (this will download the given roles from Ansible
Galaxy and place them in `roles` subdirectory; unfortunately, Ansible does not have
an option to have this done automatically):

    $ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements_roles.txt -p roles

Role variables
--------------
All of the listed variabls are stored in `defaults/main.yml`. Check that file
for all the available variables.

Individual variables can be set or overridden by setting them directly in a
playbook for this role (see an example below for `vnc_password`). Alternatively,
they can be set by creating `group_vars` directory in the root directory of the
playbook used to execute this role and placing a file with the variables there.
Note that the name of this file must match the value of `hosts` setting in the
corresponding playbook (e.g., `image-builder` for the sample playbook provided
below).

### Required variables ###
 - `vnc_password`: a password that will be baked into the image and used as a
    bridge bewteen VNC and noVNC servers
 - `psql_galaxyftp_password`: a password that will also be baked into the image
    and allows Galaxy to authenticate FTP users

### Optional variables ###
 - `galaxy_user_name`: (default: `galaxy`) system username to be used for
    Galaxy
 - `galaxyFS_base_dir`: (default: `/mnt/galaxy`) the base path under which the
    galaxy file system will be placed
 - `galaxy_server_dir`: (default: `"{{ galaxyFS_base_dir }}/galaxy-app"`) the
    location where the Galaxy application will be placed
 - `galaxy_db_dir`: (default: `"{{ galaxyFS_base_dir }}/db"`) the location wher
    Galaxy's PostgreSQL database will be placed
 - `galaxy_db_port`: (default: `5930`) the port set for Galaxy's PostgrSQL database
 - `postgresql_bin_dir`: (default: `/usr/lib/postgresql/9.3/bin`) the path where
    PostgreSQL binary files are stored. This path will be added to `$PATH`.
 - `nginx_upload_store_path`: (default: `"{{ galaxyFS_base_dir }}/upload_store"`)
    the path to which Nginx's configuration for the `upload_store` will be set
 - `indicesFS_base_dir`: (default: `/mnt/galaxyIndices`) the path where Galaxy
    reference genomes indices will be stored. Also Galaxy Data Managers will be
    installed here (via the Tool Shed, as designed by Galaxy).

### Control flow variables ###
The following variables can be set to either `yes` or `no` to indicate if the
given part of the role should be executed:
 - `cm_install_packages`: (default: `yes`) install system level packages
 - `cm_venvburrito`: (default: `yes`) whether to setup virtual burrito virtual
    environment for CloudMan
 - `cm_system_environment`: (default: `yes`) setup system-level configurations
    *Note* that setting this option also requires `cm_venvburrito` to be set.
 - `cm_system_tools`: (default: `yes`) install given tools system wide
 - `cm_install_s3fs`: (default: `yes`) whether to install S3FS or not
 - `cm_configure_nginx`: (default: `yes`) whether to configure Nginx
 - `cm_install_proftpd`: (default: `yes`) whether to install ProFTPd server
 - `cm_install_novnc`: (default: `no`) whether to install and configure VNC and
    noVNC bridge for in-browser remote desktop. *Note* that there are issues
    with setting this on AWS due to how AWS exposes graphics card hardware.
 - `cm_install_r_packages`: (default: `yes`) whether to install R and Bioconductor
    packages
 - `cleanup`: (default: `no`) whether to clean up the instance and make it ready
    for bundling into an image. This must be set before an image is created!
 - `only_cleanup`: (default: `no`) when set, only the cleanup tasks will run and
    no other. This is primarily intended to be set as a command line variable.

Example playbook
----------------
To use the role, it is necessary to launch a cloud instance, create a `hosts`
file that contains access information for the instance, for example:

    [image-builder]
    130.56.250.204 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=key.pem ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu

Next, set any variables as desired and place the role into a playbook file
(e.g., `playbook.yml`). This playbook assumes the role has been placed into
`roles/galaxyprojectdotorg.cloudman-image` directory:

    - hosts: image-builder
      sudo: yes
      roles:
        - galaxyprojectdotorg.cloudman-image
          vnc_password: <some_password>
          psql_galaxyftp_password: <a_different_password>

Finally, run the playbook with:

    $ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts [--extra-vars cleanup=yes]

**NOTE**: setting the `cleanup` variable will disable *ssh* access to the current
instance! While this is not set as the default value, an instance *must* be cleaned
before creating an image.

Upon completion, an image can be created using the cloud console.
